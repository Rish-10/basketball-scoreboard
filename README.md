# basketball-scoreboard
This is one of the first projects I ever built, where I had to use JavaScript, HTML and CSS combined. 

It is a simple scoreboard that can be used to track the score of basketball games. 

Check out the code here and if you want to see it deployed, you can do so at: https://rishiscoreboard.netlify.app

Enjoy!
